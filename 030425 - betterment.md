ITS BEEN A WHILE!!!

the desire to feel intensely has always stayed in the back of my mind, and its a word in the book
of obscure sorrows
yù yī - 玉衣
n. the desire to see with fresh eyes, and feel things just as intensely as you did when you were
younger—before expectations, before memory, before words.
ive been thinking of the concept of the “museum of failures” (and an alternative museum of
triumphs) and ive been thinking of doing it, but i also question the significance of enumerating
my failures in front of me. why would i perceive myself as a human who only fails? failure is a
great thing to ACCEPT and embrace, but its not someone’s entire being

today, i watched the documentary “hip hop and the LA riots” in my seminar about race and
policing. i thought it was really cool because it opened my eyes to the world that rappers like
NWA and tupac lived in—the music they produced couldnt fully encapsulate the violence that
occured

i think that mission statements/purposes make such good results (i’m referring to music). so
many disses and political music are made with very important intentions and they not only
achieve those intentions nine times out of ten but they also become art. the intentions behind
making music are so important and should be understood

euphoria, meet the grahams, and not like us all have different intentions… and theyre all
legendary songs

hit ‘em up was made to diss biggie and a bunch of others who identified themselves with the east
coast

but also songs like f*** the police, “the day the nz took over,” and black korea portrayed a lot of
violence in LA at the time. it was a cry for the people. it was a collective voice. it reflected the
world that the black community lived in at the time. it was their anthem.

it feels good to feel intensely again.

everyone’s gonna get changed by college in some way by their environment, but
what matters is going further. solidifying values and knowing thyself will come with time - 
uncomfortable situations are where growth occurs and college is abundant with them - 
but DOING is what makes a person. applying oneself to SIBC projects, new executive positions,
using time wisely - find yourself

someone bogged down by trauma is a victim, but someone who has come to terms with their
trauma and is actively making attempts to resolve their issues with them is strong
to know thyself, endurance is not enough - doing, applying oneself, and choosing to put oneself
in uncomfortable situations are where growth occurs.

to know thyself is to be uncomfortable
