*How do you feel about your birth gender?*
i feel good about my birth gender; i havent really questioned it until now. i dont really see a
reason to change it. like i feel like my personality just aligns with... `xericue`. it wouldnt really have
mattered if i was born a girl or guy? i wouldve found strength either way - however, i do love
being a guy. i get a lot out of just feeling cool as hell and on top of the world. i like being straight
forward and i like my guy friends. but its not even to that degree of guy friends, girl friends, or
who is straight forward - i like good people. i feel good about my birth gender - it doesn’t feel
wrong or weird to me.

it’s more so that i’ve accepted it. would i be happier if i were presenting myself like a woman? i
don’t think i’d be more happy or more sad. i don’t really resonate or like the tropes that belong to
either group like “girl gossip” or sports talk, but its never gonna be about gender.

*What gender do you wish people saw you as?*
i wish people saw me as `xericue`.

*How would you like to express your gender?*
i enjoy fashion; but, whether or not my outfits are on me or a girl version of myself, i think that the 
outfit itself speaks as opposed to a traditional category that i want to convey.

“my only conclusion about my gender expression is just that i strive for what i personally find
fulfilling no matter the perceived image”

conclusion about gender identity: Yeah I’m just `xericue` man whatever yall want

“i dont feel detached from the gender binary but i also dont gender traits or gender things to me. i
feel like a guy but there is More”
