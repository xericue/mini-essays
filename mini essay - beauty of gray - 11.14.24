“ - black, white, and the beauty of gray: embracing the spectrum of human emotion - “


i enjoy being sad, but it definitely sucks. there are a lot of different types of sadness that i
am grateful to experience—i felt very lonely when my teammates were getting ice cream and
making group chats without me.

however, i remain grateful for these moments because they compose me. after denying
emotions—deeming myself emotionless, considering emotions useless, and feeling deficient for
being —and considering them useless for so long, i came to relish the ability to feel emotions the
way i can. without ever telling one of my friends my qualms about my being sensitive, she talked
about how she was jealous of emotional people since they view the world in such a beautiful
way.

And, when I look into the sky above my college’s lake almost every night, I cannot help
but long to wonder about the stars. Since I have been young, outer space has always remained as
some ethereal beauty, something Elysian. A constant reminder of human limits and a world
greater than the minutiae of human affairs. As much as we may mathematically deteriorate or
meticulously reduce beauty, the threshold of outer space’s beauty will always be low. Realizing
that my appreciation is unrequited from the universe, I feel grateful, melancholic, and grateful
for my melancholy. It seems a bit contradictory that something unachievable and, ironically,
uncaring about emotions brings me such comfort in solitude. Language changes, but the stars
will continue to burn. Buildings crumble, but black holes spin and adhere to their own laws. As
much as we destroy our world, nature takes its intended course with time, and animals like we
humans can try as hard as possible to carve a living space in it.

Human emotions can become overwhelmingly layered and nuanced.

But I have also felt so much joy.
A large part of my identity is trying to be a philokalist in every facet of my life.
How can I appreciate beauty in all things more every day?
Am I merely romanticizing the common human experience?
Do high highs come with low lows or do we have a tendency to compare the two when, in
reality, they are separate?

There comes a point at which appreciation must be combated with action to grow.

Ew. But aw.
